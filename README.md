Abstract (150 words)

Extreme wind-driven autumn wildfires are particulourly hazardous to life and property, due to their rapid rate of spread. Recent catastrophic autumn wildfires in the western United States co-occurred with record- to near-record autumn fire weather indices that are a byproduct of fuel dryness and strong offshore dry winds. Here, we use a formal, probabilistic, extreme event attribution analysis to investigate the recent extreme autumn fire weather events. We show that present-day anthropogenic climate change (ACC) slightly decreases the prevalence of strong off-shore, downslope winds from Oregon to Southern California. However, ACC has already increased the likelihood of extreme fire weather by 40%, primarily through increased autumn fuel aridity and warmer temperatures during dry wind events. Our findings illustrate that ACC is already exacerbating autumn fire weather extremes that strongly contribute to high-impact catastrophic fires in populated regions of the western US.
